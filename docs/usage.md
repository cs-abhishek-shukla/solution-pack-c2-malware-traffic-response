# Usage 
 
Refer to [Simulate Scenario documentation](https://github.com/fortinet-fortisoar/solution-pack-soc-simulator/blob/develop/docs/usage.md) to understand how to simulate and reset scenarios. 
 
To understand the process FortiSOAR follows to respond to phishing emails, we have included a scenario &mdash; **Malicious C2 Outbound Traffic** with this solution pack. Refer to the section Malicious C2 Outbound Traffic to understand how this solution pack automation addresses your needs. 
 
## Malicious C2 Outbound Traffic

This scenario generates an example alert of Type *Beaconing* in FortiSOAR's **Alerts** module.

Navigate to the demo alert and note the following:

- The demo alert created is an example of Palo Alto Firewall blocking an outbound connection that was using a C2 port
- The alert is of the type *Beaconing*
- The reported alert contains the following among other related sources data:
    - Source IP address
    - Destination IP address
    - Source port
    - Destination port

Users can launch **Investigate C2 Malware Traffic** playbook to take action on the demo alert created.

These playbooks perform the following automated tasks:
- IP addresses associated with alert is investigated and, when found malicious, blocked on the firewall
- Affected host is isolated for further investigation and scanning
- Searching for known IOCs for C2 Malicious Traffic based on IP Addresses found
