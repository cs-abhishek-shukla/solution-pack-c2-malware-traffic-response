# C2 Malware Traffic Response

## Overview

### Introduction

This article describes the C2 Malware Traffic Response Solution Pack. This solution pack demonstrates the scenarios and usecase around the C2(Command and Control) Attacks. The scenario generates a demo alert for the Alert Type 'Beaconing' for 'Malicious C2 Outbound Traffic'.

In such attacks, the malware-infected system establishes a connection with the attacker's server (C2 server) to maintain communication with the infected system. The attacker uses such attacks to gain control over the system, data theft or download other malicious software.

The use-case deals with containment and investigation procedures once the Outbound Connection Attempt Using Known C2 Port is detected.
