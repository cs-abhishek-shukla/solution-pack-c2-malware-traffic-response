## Overview

### Introduction

*C2 Malware Traffic Response Solution Pack* is designed to provide a set of investigation and utility playbooks to respond to C2 attacks.

In such attacks, the malware-infected system connects with the attacker's server (C2 server) to maintain communication with the infected system. The attacker uses such attacks to gain control over the system, steal data, or download other malicious software.

The use-case deals with containment and investigation procedures once the Outbound Connection Attempt Using Known C2 Port is detected.

### Usage

[Refer](https://github.com/fortinet-fortisoar/solution-pack-soc-simulator/blob/develop/docs/solution-pack-guide.md) to Simulate Scenario documentation to understand how to Simulate and Reset scenarios.

This Solution Pack ships with the following simulation scenarios. 

#### 1. Scenario - Malicious C2 Outbound Traffic
